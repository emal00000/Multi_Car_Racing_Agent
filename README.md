# Multi Car Racing
In this project, we explore the development and evaluation of the behaviors in multi-agent car racing. Our approach focuses on creating an abstraction of a complex multi-agent environment to be able to run it efficiently on mid-range PCs. Our abstraction focuses on reducing the state representation by focusing on a subset of the track that is represented as a sequence of points. Through this abstraction, we developed an agent capable of efficiently navigating the track, making significant progress toward the finish line.

## Environment Setup
1. Follow the installation instructions provided in the "multi_car_racing" repository linked below:
  - [Multi Car Racing](https://github.com/Sedwall/multi_car_racing)
2. Update line 17 in `requirements.txt` to point to the `multi_car_racing` directory cloned in the previous step.
3. Run the installation with the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
