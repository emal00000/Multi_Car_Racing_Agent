# Multi Car Racing
In this project, we explore the development and evaluation of the behaviors in multi-agent car racing. Our approach focuses on creating an abstraction of a complex multi-agent environment to be able to run it efficiently on mid-range PCs. Our abstraction focuses on reducing the state representation by focusing on a subset of the track that is represented as a sequence of points. Through this abstraction, we developed an agent capable of efficiently navigating the track, making significant progress toward the finish line.
